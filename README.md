# CompMatSciTools  
A collection of tools meant to make various tasks easier when performing computational materials science research. The open-source molecular dynamics (MD) code [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org) is my MD code of choice. Most of my research thus far has been in predicting thermo-mechanical properties of polymer composites, and this collection of tools reflects that focus.
